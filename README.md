# Stereo-seq analysis workflow
Stereo-seq, developed by STOmics, is a sequencing based spatial data platform, allowing for high-resolution (500nm), large-field-of-view analysis of gene expression in tissue, enabling the mapping of cells and their spatial relationships. Spatial data from Stereo-seq uses a different format as other spatial techniques (e.g.10X Visium or Slide-seq). Though Stereopy provided in-depth code for downstream analysis, it is not a straight-forward workflow (at least not to me), especially not for a project with multiple samples. Here I provide two workflow for downstream analysis: 1) using Stereopy; 2) convert the Stereo-seq data to seurat RDS using addImg2annData developed by @limin321, this way you can analyze your Stereo-seq data the same as 10X Visium data.
